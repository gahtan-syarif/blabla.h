# BlaBla PRNG
C++ implementation of JP Aumasson's (BlaBla)[https://github.com/veorq/blabla/blob/master/BlaBla.swift] PRNG (64-bit version of ChaCha based on Blake2b). Should run faster than ChaCha for 64-bit systems.

Code is derived from (Orson Peters' C++ ChaCha PRNG implementation)[https://gist.github.com/orlp/32f5d1b631ab092608b1]
